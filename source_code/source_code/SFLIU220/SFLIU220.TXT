Hello, SFLIU fans!

Seems like not too long ago that Derek and released SFLIU V2.10, saying
that it would be the last release from us.  Well, soon after we released
V2.10, I started playing around with a few files, and we decided to
share them with you.

SFLIU V2.20 was released with basically two purposes, to fix some minor
bugs in SFLIU V2.10, and to add a "Super Street Fighter 2" mode, based
(loosely) on the SSF2 arcade game.  Some new SSF2 sound effects are
included, but very few new graphics, as inserting new graphics is an 
extremely long process (i.e. no DeeJay, Cammy, T. Hawk or Fei Long :( )

Note that *YOU MUST HAVE SFLIU V2.10* in order for SFLIU V2.20 to be
any use!!!  To install SFLIU V2.20, just unzip SFLIU V2.20 into your
SFLIU V2.10 directory, opting to overwrite all files.  After proper
installation, there will be an option for SSF2 mode when SF2.BAT is run.

If you don't have SFLIU V2.10, you can FTP it at:

        ftp.krl.caltech.edu  - /pub/fighting/sf2/sfliu

And possibly at:

        csula-ps.caltech.edu - /users/kid/sf2
        wuarchive.wustl.edu  - /pub/msdos_uploads/games/sf2

When's the next SFLIU coming out, and will we do TSSF2?  Probably not
for quite a long time, and probably not, since schoolwork is always
building up for us, there are some major gameplay changes in TSSF2 that
the crude SF2IBM executable just can't handle.  (Heck, there are lots
of things in the EXE that don't even match the original Street Fighter 2!)
We'll see, though.

Greets as always to the beta-test team: Isabel, Ben, Wayne, Winson, Dave,
Doug, Albert, Grant, Clarence, Kee, Kevin, Kevan, Dennis, Shaolin, Shaopin,
James and Jacky.


Have fun, and happy Street Fighting!


Brian
