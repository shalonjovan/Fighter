=============================

To thank:  Chan Chee Meng (*)
           Stan Warman (**)

List of changes since SFLIU2.0à : (hope we got them all!)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAJOR BUG FIXES
===============

1.  SF2196 has a bug where it is possible to slam a opponent that has fallen,
    reeling back, getting up, or in block stun.  Now is it not able to slam
    an opponent that is lying down or getting up.  This change does have its
    side effects, such as Chun Li losing her Flipping Neck Kick when the
    opponent is lying on the ground.  But we felt that this change in gameplay
    took more priority than the drawbacks.  However, it is not possible
    to fix slamming during reeling back or in block stun, so take it easy on
    the ticking!
**2.  The bug that caused the game to crash in an Andy vs. Andy or Terry vs.
    Terry match has been fixed.  Thanks to Stan Warman for this fix.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    to Stan Warman.
**7.  Got rid of that annoying "blip" in Zangief's standing pose.  Thanks to
    Stan Warman for this fix.

      -Tiger

SFLIU 1.1 -> SFLIU V2.0alpha

-Updated for 1.96 compatibility
-Character's movements, attacks, special moves, reeling back frames, hit
 damages, hit ranges, winning poses, losing poses all edited
-Attacks modified to hit only once
-Attacks modified to be blockable  (Many attacks in the original SF2IBM 1.96
 were unblockable)
-Combos are still possible for the 10 SF2 characters, but on a 486, they are
 hard to execute, if not impossible, due to the game not slowing down when
 one gets hit.  Hopefully they will be easier to execute in the final release.
-Computer combos are unchanged for the original 8 characters, the new
 characters do not have computer combos yet.


BALROG/TERRY BOGARD

-Key sequences for special attacks/slams changed to mirror FF more closely
-Dash backwards now invincible
-Losing (lying on floor) pose now does not move
-Exploding Power Wave now does not disappear when it hits
-Burning Knuckle now knocks down

-See "In General"


M.BISON

-Now falls completely down when hit out of Torpedo by special move
-See "In General"


SFLIU V1.0 -> SFLIU V1.1
========================

GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS:

-Getting up is now interruptable (eg. you can now "break out" into DP while
 getting up.  This should stop people standing by you waiting for you to get
 up so they can slam you.  Just do a DP motion as you get up)
-EXE changed so the score bar doesn't overflow when the score turns negative
 (Thanks to Stan Warman for this one!)
-Honda's hair in losing pose fixed (Thanks to Duc Tran for this one!)
-HYPCHAR.SF2 now has correct (metric!!!) stats
-New music from SF2IBM 1.96!
-Getting hit by electricity/fire, falling dizzy subroutines adjusted to
 match more closely with the arcade
-Can now air slam with neutral direction.  Air slam with up removed.  This
 change was implemented since unlike the arcade, one usually does not hold
 onto a direction when jumping.
-Blanka's jumping fierce, Dhalsim and Zangief jumping attacks no longer hit
 below the ground
-Some computer combos upgraded in strength


RYU/KEN

-Dragon Punch now hits Dhalsim's slide
-Ken now has "instant" DP (Do a crouching fierce/DP and you'll see what I
 mean)
-Added standing (close) forward attack
-End of crouching fierce was accidentally made interruptable.  Fixed.
-Standing (far) fierce was accidentally made interruptable.  Fixed.
-Ken's DP descending speed rewritten
-Vertical range of CK increased


E.HONDA

-Now able to block standing (close) roundhouse
-Start of Sumo Head Butt now invincible, Jab Head Butt is now able to go
 go through projectiles
-Sumo Butt Crush completely rewritten.  Also, the delay after the Butt
 Crush was shortened, and a high punch can now hit the recovery.


BLANKA

-Now flips at the end of the bite
-Electricity range decreased (Before, it was a little too hard to hit Blanka
 out of electricity)
-Crouching strong changed to crouching-fierce-type graphic

GUILE

-End of standing (close) fierce accidentally made interruptable.  Fixed.
-Removed sound effects when slamming opponent
-Now crouched opponents cannot be hit with jumping punches
-Blade kick range adjusted (it was too easy to hit someone behind you)
-Blade kick descending graphic changed


CHUN LI

-Standing (close) strong now misses crouched opponent
-Standing (close) roundhouse now hits a crouched opponent
-Jumping straight height decreased
-Rewrote flip kick attack


ZANGIEF

-SPD changed to Up + Fierce (a lot of people were complaining that the SPD
was too hard to do.  We discovered that the difficulty was not due to the
diagonal direction required, but rather due to a bug in the extended-throw
range flag the SPD was given.  Fixing the bug required the keystrokes change
to just Up + Fierce.  In any case, it should be a lot easier to do a SPD now)


DHALSIM

-Walking/jumping speed adjusted to HF speeds
-Crouching fierce can no longer go under a Sonic Boom
-"Dead spot" for Yoga Fire decreased
-Teleport speed increase (it was too easy to hit Dhalsim after reappearing)

Original SF2IBM -> SFLIU V1.0
=============================
In General:

-Faster gameplay!
-Hyper Fighting moves added! ( Blanka's vertical roll, etc.)
-Computer can perform combos and does "pattern" moves like the arcade
 (e.g. Ken does 3 DP's in a row, jumps back and forth, Fierce/DP combo)
 Pattern moves inflict massive damage, making the computer a real threat!
-Intense .VOC's!  Recorded from Capcom SF2 soundtrack!  Country Names!  Sound
 effects for punches/kicks!
-True interruptible moves!  Try your favorite combos! (Fierce/Fierce/DP!)
 (Fierce/Fierce/Blade kick!)  All combos in the arcade are possible here!
-Attacks only hit once (no more quadruple jumping shorts, double fierces)
-Damage index lowered (no more redizzies like Fierce/Double DP until death!)
-Shortened block recovery time (this makes it possible to block high attack
 followed by low attack)
-Dizzy period varies with character (e.g. Zangief shorter, Chun Li longer)
-Increased delay time after "charge" type attacks, as no charging is needed
 in SF2IBM
-Characters jump higher/longer/further when jumping backwards
-Fixed everybody's winning/losing pose
-Many other fixes regarding things like knockdowns, hit ranges of moves, 
 adjustment of movements during attacks, interruptability of moves, jumping
 and walking speed, special move speed and power or all characters, slide
 back time after getting hit, etc.

-In general, a much more fun SF2IBM!  Human vs. Human is much more playable,
 and even Human vs. Computer is fun!  (The computer beats me if I'm not
 careful!)
