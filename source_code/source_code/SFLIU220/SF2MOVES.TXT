SFLIU Combos
------------

One of the nifty features of the SFLIU patch is the ability to perform
combos.  A combo in SF2IBM is done much like a combo in the arcade.  One
simply triggers a special move before a normal move has finished attacking.
For example, for Ken's Fierce/Fierce/DP combo, trigger a DP sequence after
Ken's fist has connected for the second fierce, while the fist is still
retracting.  This "buffering" causes the animation sequence of the fierce
punch to interrupt into a DP sequence.  The timing of the keystrokes would
be something like:  "Tap...TapTap".  Practice the timing for combos - you 
might learn how to perform a combo in the arcade by playing SFLIU! :)


Examples of some combos would be:

Ken/Ryu :  Jumping Fierce, Standing Fierce, Jab DP
           Jumping Roundhouse, Crouching Forward, Fierce Fireball
Guile   :  Jumping Fierce, Standing Fierce, Short Blade Kick
           Jumping Forward, Crouching Strong, Fierce Sonic Boom
Chun Li :  Jumping Fierce, Standing Fierce, Short Lightning Kick
Dhalsim :  Crouching Short (Slide), Fierce Yoga Fire
Balrog  :  Jumping Fierce, Crouching Short, Standing Short, Jab Charging
            Straight
Vega    :  Jumping Fierce, Crouching Jab, Fierce Roll, Crouching Jab
           Jumping Fierce, Crouching Strong, Fierce Roll, Crouching Jab (*)
Sagat   :  Jumping Fierce, Standing Short, Jab Tiger Uppercut           (%)
           Jumping Roundhouse, Crouching Jab, Roundhouse Tiger Knee     (%)
           Jumping Roundhouse, Standing Roundhouse, Jab Tiger Uppercut  (*)
M.Bison :  Jumping Roundhouse, Crouching Jab, Fierce Psycho Crusher
           Jumping Fierce, Crouching Jab, Standing Jab, Short Scissor Kick
