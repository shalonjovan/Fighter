I am starting on a FAQ for people who want to create their own SFIBM 
characters, here is a part of it where I am describing the .SEQ file.
If possible could any of you help to fill in some of it.  Later I will
add instructions on how to add graphics, and which files are used for 
which graphic.

To create new characters

1. Get a sample picture, see if the background is a different palette from
   the character. (screen theif/pcxdump; neopaint)
2. If so, get pictures of character frames
3. Find out the BKG colors, take it out (may need to crop) (display)
4. Save palette and load it onto other pictures, remove unused color and
   autocrop (display)
5. Change 1st color to lighter grey
6. Load SFIBM palette
7. Change color 1 to 42:16:32
8. Change new BKG color to 16:16:32 (can save 7 and 8 as a palette)
9. Save as PCX, run one2ide (batch)
10. Check with LSP, all messed up palettes, just change to next even #
