SFPygame is a remake of  SFIBM made with python and pygame.

SFIBM is the first editable fighting game on PC that spawned a lot
of street fighter hacks and other crossovers in the 90's, it has also inspired the M.U.G.E.N creators and other
fighting game engines like Truefenix's SFR and UFGE engines.

SFPygame load SFIBM's original resources, so SFPygame.EXE must be in the same directory as SFIBM's.

note: you can play SFIBM with DOSbox emulator.
