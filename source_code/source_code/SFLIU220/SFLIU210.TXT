Version 2.10
Released September 22, 1994
By Derek Liu (deliu@unixg.ubc.ca) and Brian Chan (chanav@sfu.ca)
Documentation by Brian Chan

SFLIU V2.10 needs no other previous patch to function; it is a complete game.
The reason for the complete release is that there was some confusion regarding
the distribution of SFLIU V2.00.  To avoid any further confusion, V2.10 will be
distributed as an entire game.  Sysops and FTP Sysadmins may delete V2.00 and
V2.01 when V2.10 is released.

Well, over the holidays, both Derek and I have finally found some time to
get the V2.10 patch done, and do some proper play testing and documentation.
We apologize for the "rushed" release of V2.00, where numerous bugs and
other problems reared their ugly head, but things were very hectic back
then, and we were already very late for the V2.00 release, and those things
just slipped through.  Hopefully there will be none of that in V2.10.

SFLIU V2.10 is designed to improve upon the original game by Jung Young Dug.
Note that Derek and I did *not* program the game.  This vastly limits the
scope of what we can do with the game.  That is also why we were unable to
use many fine suggestions, such as adding support for joysticks, modems,
GUS, PAS, bonus rounds etc.  SFLIU was originally designed to be applied
as a patch to SF2IBM, but when we started editing graphics, the size of
the patch would be approximately equal to the entire game.  That is why
we are packaging SF2IBM with SFLIU.

Also please note that V2.10 refers to the revision number of the SFLIU
patches, NOT the original game.  The game is still at V1.96.  There is NO
functional difference between the EXE's distributed with SFLIU and the
original game.

As explained in the V2.00 docs, you may not use any part of the SFLIU patches
in your own work without permission from myself or Derek first.  After
receiving permission, you must mention _ALL_ the aspects of your work that
originally came from SFLIU in your documentation.  And you may _NOT_ release
a patch for SFLIU (a patch for a patch?)  Sorry if this sounds a little
high-handed, but Derek and I were definitely not amused by some people (who
shall remain nameless) that plagiarized our work, and passed it off as their
own.


What is SFLIU?:
===============

SFLIU is made by Derek Liu and Brian Chan, and it attempts to make SF2IBM
play as closely as possible to the Street Fighter II Turbo Hyper Fighting
arcade game by Capcom.  Note that the original SF2IBM was made by Jung
Young Dug.

When SF2IBM was released (especially with V1.96) it had appallingly bad
gameplay.  Bearing little resemblance to the arcade, animation would be
choppy, attacks would constantly dizzy, hit more than once, and shift
mysteriously in position, as well as having sound that left a lot to be
desired.  One of the primary aims of SFLIU was to improve the gameplay.
After many hours of hard work and experimentation, Derek more or less
rewrote the attack and getting hit routines so attacks would only hit
once.  The hit reactions were tuned to mimic the arcade, and certain
moves were made interruptable, so that combos in the arcade could be
done in SF2IBM.  It was a lot of work, but the end result was worth it.
We think you'll notice the difference too!

How to install SFLIU:
=====================

Unzip SFLIU V2.10 into an empty directory, and run SF2.BAT.  The first time
SF2.BAT is run, it will duplicate necessary sound effects and call SF2CFG.EXE
to configure the game.

See below on configuration tips.


How to configure the game:
==========================

The file SF2CFG.EXE configures SF2IBM for your system.  When run, a menu
will be displayed.  Use the up/down keys to move between fields and
the enter key to selct.

EXTENDED MEMORY VERSION:  Selecting this will display the amount of free
                          extended memory (XMS) in your system.

Setting Left/Right Player Control Key:  This allows you to configure the
                                        keys used to control your character.

Setting Video Speed (Automatic):  Run this first.

Checking Video Speed (Manual):  Valid values range from 1 - 3750.  Higher
                                values correspond to a slower game.

Voice Source Select:  Selects voice source.

View Current Configuration State:  Views current configuration state.

Save & Quit:  Selecting this option will save your changes and quit.

Quit:  Selecting this option will quit without saving any changes.


How to run SFLIU:
=================

Well, we put this section in since many of you had trouble playing the game.

SF2.BAT runs SFLIU.

The keys used in SF2IBM:

F1 - Enter debugging mode.  Most people will not need to use this key.
F2 - Restart match.
F5 - Some sort of screen test.  Useless function.
F8 - Memory test.  Useless function.
F9 - Toggle pause.  Pressing a key while in pause mode will advance the
     action by one frame.
F10 - Return to main menu.
ESC - Exit to DOS.

The default player keys.  These can all be changed in SF2CFG.EXE:

                Player 1           Player 2

Jump            T                  Up Arrow
Left            F                  Left Arrow
Right           H                  Right Arrow
Down            G                  Down Arrow
Jab             TAB                INS
Strong          Q                  HOME
Fierce          W                  PGUP
Short           CAPS LOCK          DEL
Forward         A                  END
Roundhouse      S                  PGDN


When the game starts up, there will be a repeating intro, showing the
faces of the twelve fighters, and then showing a brief profile of each
of them.  Press any Player 2 key to display the main menu.  The menu
consists of:  One Player, Two Players, and Options.

Selecting "One Player" will start a 1 player game.  Only Player 2's controls
maybe be used.  There will be a selection screen with the faces of the
twelve fighters.  Use Player 2's direction keys to move the selection cursor,
and an attack key to choose your fighter.

Selecting "Two Players" will start a 2 player game.  Both Player 1 and Player
2 use their respective direction keys to move their selection cursors, and any
attack button to select their fighter.

Selecting "Options" will display an option menu.  Here, offensive and
defensive strengths can be adjusted, as well as number of rounds required
to win, and time per round.  There is also a music and sound effects
test.  The up and down keys will move between fields, and the attack
keys and/or the return key will adjust the field or select the option.
To accept the new options, pick "Accept".  To abort, pick "Exit".  The
options will stay in effect until you change them or exit to DOS.

While playing a 1 player game, a second player may be added at any time
simply by pressing an attack key for the appropriate player.


Tips to make SFLIU more fun!
============================

If you don't have a human opponent to play with, playing the computer can
be boring sometimes.  Despite all the changes we made to make the computer
_appear_ smarter, the computer still is pretty stupid, not knowing when
to block, and doing moves at random intervals.  Here's a few suggestions
to make 1-player SFLIU a _bit_ more fun:

In "Options" turn computer's Offense and Defence levels _up_ to about 3/4
full.  Turn your Offense and Defence level _down_ to about 1/4 full.  If you
really want to have fun, turn the computer's levels to totally full and
yours to totally empty (and watch a beautifully timed Fierce/Fierce/DP take
off about 2 pixels... :)

Don't just stand on the other side of the screen and fireball all day, try
to get closer to the computer.  The computer is programmed to be a bit more
aggressive when you're close up.

If the computer FB's, try to Cyclone Kick/Spinning Bird Kick/Sumo Torpedo/
Sumo Butt Splash/Dragon Punch/Lariat/Teleport/TAP or backflip through it.

Try to practice a few combos.  Try starting with Ken/Ryu's standard
Jumping Roundhouse/Crouching Forward/Fireball, then try Jumping Fierce/
Crouching Fierce/DP.  Of if you're Guile, try Jumping Roundhouse/Standing
Fierce/Blade Kick.  Or if you're Chun Li, try Jumping Fierce/Standing Fierce/
Lightning Kick.  Hopefully all the combos you can do in the arcade, you can
do in SFLIU, as well.


Limitations of SF2IBM:
======================

Even though lots of work was put in to improve the gameplay of SF2IBM, there
are still tons of limitations in the EXE that we are not able to change.
Here are some of them, listed in no particular order:

 o SF2IBM V1.96 has a number of bugs with its slamming routines.  In the
   original SF2IBM V1.96, slams would be allowed while the other person was
   still in block stun, reeling back from a hit, or lying on the ground.
   We have managed to get around slamming while lying on the ground, but
   the first two problems remain (making ticking disgustingly easy and
   impossible to counterthrow) :(  Also, our crude fix has some other
   side effects associated with it:  the loss of short range moves while
   the opponent is fallen (that is why Chun Li cannot do her flipping neck
   breaker on a fallen opponent).

 o The computer is able to do a ground slam or a computer combo while in the
   air.

 o Occasionally crashes to DOS with the message "Mem Error".

 o There is a bug with the interrupt flags in the SEQ.  This can be most
   often seen by a character not falling down properly, or a double image
   appearing whenever the character is hit.  Restarting the match should
   eliminate this problem.

 o Unlike SF2IBM V1.90, there is no longer any slight slowdown when playing
   a VOC.  While crude, this slowdown did approximate the slowdown in the
   arcade while a combo was being performed.  The lack of a slowdown
   makes combos much more difficult to do in SF2IBM V1.96.

 o There is no ending upon completion of the game.

 o The KEY file (listing of special moves) is limited to very few entries.

 o The SEQ file (animation sequence) is limited to approximately 550
   entries.  This does not pose a problem yet, and is certainly a vast
   improvement over the 400 entries allowed in SF2IBM V1.90.

 o The vulnerable range of a character's sprites cannot be adjusted.  That
   is why the leg portion Chun Li's wind kick is vulnerable.

 o While moves can be specified in the air (i.e. Ken/Ryu's aerial Cyclone
   Kick) there is no way to determine exactly when in the jump the move
   was executed.  Therefore it is impossible to determine how many frames
   it takes to land.  This would result in a character floating above or
   below the ground, which can lead to more problems.  All animations in
   SF2IBM need to have their exact movements mapped out.  This is also
   related to the reason why M. Bison's Head Stomp often misses an
   opponent, or why Vega cannot air slam from the wall jump.

 o Characters cannot jump off the walls.

 o There is no "hit flag" to specify when an attack has hit.  That is why
   jumping jab/shorts do not last for the whole jump.  The previous SF2IBM's
   would have jumping attacks hitting up to 4 times.  That is also why
   Blanka's roll hits multiple times.

 o Cannot tune dizzy power.  Currently, the dizzy power is directly
   proportional to the damage of a move.  That is why 2 fireballs do not
   dizzy (Fireballs don't take off that much, in general) and occasionally
   a combo will redizzy (such as Ken's Fierce/Fierce/Double DP).  Redizzying
   is also related to the game's crude "dizzy meter".

 o Moves that require "charging" do not work properly.  While charging, no
   other key may be pressed.  Also, the charge period required is too long
   in proportion to the game.  (i.e. Guile cannot jump and charge in time
   for his combos)

 o Characters are able to overlap.

 o Key conflicts are common in two player matches.  If one player is already
   pressing many of his keys, the computer will not register any more
   keystrokes.

 o Close up attacks only take effect if the opponent is on the ground.

 o If an opponent is high enough in the air, the falldown flag will not
   work.  (i.e. DP'ing a jumping opponent will result in him/her landing
   on his feet)

 o There is a severe lack of hit reactions available.  Since in SFLIU,
   there are many different types of hit reactions depending on which attack
   is used to hit an opponent, there were many other reactions that we
   could not put in.  Ideally, we would like to have at least 2 falldown
   animations (1 from a sweep, and 1 from a special move), and be able to put
   in Bison's blue torpedo hit, etc. etc.

 o The characters expand upon winning.

 o Backgrounds cannot be animated and interactive (i.e. objects break when
   player falls on them)

 o No bonus stages.

 o Cannot shake out of dizziness and holds.

 o Fast computers will often cut short the playing of a sound effect.

There are also some problems that only a few people have encountered.  We
personally haven't experienced any of these, so please let us know if you
encounter any of these problems:

 o The Startup screen keeps crashing if you let it go to Ryu's stats.

 o The select screen takes ages to load the plane flying anim and noise.

 o After you've won a fight and the computer has to choose another fighter,
   it doesn't ping around, it just sticks to one face, then just before
   selection, zips to the one it wants to select.


Special Thanks:
===============

This last version of SFLIU is specially dedicated to the poor sap at
Aberdeen who got dizzied 3 times in a row by the HF CPU Vega's awesome
crouching fierce-crouching fierce-crouching fierce-crouching fierce combo :)

Special thanks to Ben Cantrick for his image converters.  Although they
never quite worked properly, as explained in his documentation, they were
a great help in making Balrog and Vega, and the other graphical improvements.

Thanks to the beta-test team:  Isabel, Ben, Wayne, Winson, Dave, Doug,
Albert, Grant, Clarence, Kee, Kevin, Kevan, Dennis, Shaolin, Shaopin,
James and Jacky for their support and help.

Thanks to everyone who wrote to us with comments and suggestions, in
particular Chan Chee Meng, who was a great help with his many fine ideas
and advice.

Of course, thanks to Jung Young Dug for this wonderful game.


Things to come in future releases of SFLIU:
===========================================

Unfortunately, school and other commitments have effectively "retired" us
from the SF2IBM patch business.  V2.10 will probably be the last patch
released for a long time.

There are currently no plans to release a SSF2 or a TSSF2 patch.
(Unless someone knows how to edit the EXE ... :) )


Questions?  Comments?  Complaints?  Suggestions?  Bug reports?
